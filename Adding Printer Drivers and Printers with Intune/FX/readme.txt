* Correspond to the company name change. 
  The driver settings cannot be taken over because you cannot upgrade the driver
  from the older version. Please clean install the new version. 

---------------------------------------------------
3. General Comments
---------------------------------------------------
* Close all the running applications before installing the print driver.

* Always reboot the computer after installing an upgraded version of the print
  driver.

* If you have deleted an older version of the print driver, always reboot the
  computer before installing the new version.

* Some applications provide printing options pertaining to the number of copies
  and collated copies. Always select the printing options in the application
  unless the instructions specify otherwise. Use the print driver dialogs to
  select advanced options such as 2-Sided Print, Sample Set or options that
  are not available in the application.

* Always close the print driver dialogs and/or the application Print dialog box
  before you make any changes to the default settings of the print driver via
  the Control Panel.

* If your Job Offset output does not work well with the collated copies, you
  may try to deselect the [Collate] option in the application and check the
  [Collate] check box in the print driver.

* If a Fax Phonebook is not initialized or created by the current user, he/she
  may not be granted the authority to access it. For such inappropriate access
  by users, the driver will display an error message indicating that the default
  Fax Phonebook cannot be located or the specified Fax Phonebook cannot be
  recognized.
  On the other hand, if a user would like his/her Fax Phonebook to be accessed
  by other users, he/she has to specify the groups and users whose access
  he/she wants to allow, and must grant them at least the 'Change' permission
  to the Fax Phonebook data file.

* A fax job has to be sent separately to each recipient who is specified with 
  the F-code, Password or secure send attributes.
  Otherwise, the printer always disregards the F-code, Password and secure send
  attributes when sending a fax job to multiple recipients. The transmitted job
  is always printed directly at all specified destinations.

* For the installation through the networks, if you right-click
  on [Printer] folder, go to [Run as administrator] from the menu and select
  [Add printer...], printer icon may not be generated.

* Rename a Printer Icon should comply OS file naming convention. Use Symbols or
  special characters may incur renaming error or unexpected print driver
  behavior.

* Before installing a print driver in the Windows cluster environment, you need
  to install it on each node in the cluster.

---------------------------------------------------
4. Limitations
---------------------------------------------------
* When specifying paper color from the driver, please use the latest controller ROM. 

* When monitoring print jobs with this driver, please use Fujifilm Document Monitor
  ver. 2 or later.

* Modified to support Package-Aware.  In the shared printer environment,
  Administrator rights necessary for printer driver installation may not be
  required.

* Restrictions on Package-Aware Support Driver
  - The driver is not a Microsoft WHQL Certified Driver.
  - Installed using installation tool.
  - Upgraded using the upgrade tool (VerUp.exe).
  - Installed using the setup disk created with setup disk creation tool
    (MakeDisk.exe).

  For a Server-Client environment, when the Server side printer driver fulfills
  any of the above condition, a dialog prompting user to install the printer
  driver or the User Account Control dialog may be displayed on the Client side.

* About [Prioritize Application Specified Color when Output Color is Black & White]
  For print output that is consistent with color settings specified by application UI,
  set both [Uses the dmColor specified on the application] on the [Advanced] tab
  and [Prioritize Application Specified Color when Output Color is Black & White] to [On].
  The function, [Prioritize Application Specified Color when Output Color is Black & White]
  is available when the following two conditions are satisfied.
  - [Uses the dmColor specified on the application] is set to [ON].
  - [Output Color] on the [Paper/Output] or [Color Options] tab is set to [Black and White].

  The following describes the relationship between printer driver settings
  ([Output Color], [Uses the dmColor specified on the application], and 
  [Prioritize Application Specified Color when Output Color is Black & White])
  and print output.

  * [Uses the dmColor specified on the application]: [Off]
    Output Color specified by the application will be ignored, and driver UI's
    [Output Color] setting will be used for printing.

  * [Uses the dmColor specified on the application]: [On]
    - [Prioritize Application Specified Color when Output Color is Black & White]: [On]
      Output Color specified by the application will be used for printing.
      If no Output Color has been specified by the application, driver UI's
      [Output Color] setting will be used for printing.

    - [Prioritize Application Specified Color when Output Color is Black & White]: [Off]
      If driver UI's [Output Color] setting is [Color], Output Color specified
      by the application will be used for printing.
      If driver UI's [Output Color] setting is [Black and White], Output Color
      specified by the application will be ignored, and print output will be in
      black and white.
      If no Output Color has been specified by the application, driver UI's
      [Output Color] setting will be used for printing.

* About the use of the shared printer
  If any of the following resulted under the shared printer environment, 
  it may be printed properly by changing the value of 
  [Render print jobs on client computers].
  - Annotation/ Watermark is not printing properly, even with these specified.
  - The authentication setting is not reflected properly, or the authentication 
  pop-up does not appear.

* Functional Limitations of EMF Spooling
  When [EMF Spooling] of [Advanced Settings] tab is set to [Enabled],
  the following features may not function normally.
  To use these features, set [EMF Spooling] to [Disabled].
  - [Secure Print][Sample Set][Delayed Print]
  - [Enable Account Setup][User Details Setup]
  - [Notify Job Completion by E-mail]
  - [Annotation]
  - [Insert Separators] of [Covers / Separators]

* On Microsoft Windows 8.1 or later versions select a printer from the [Devices
  and Printers] folder. Select Property of the printer and click the [Change
  Sharing Options] button on the [Sharing] tab.
  Then, specify Custom Paper Size.

* Default resolution of this driver is 600dpi. (Denoted by Auto.)
  When outputting through a driver, of which resolution is different from the
  one of this driver, errors such as the followings may be observed depending
  on specifications or limitations of an application.
  - Printed layout of the documents is changed.
  - Printed result of lines or patterns is changed.
  - Unnecessary lines are printed on the output.
  - Necessary lines are not printed on the output.

  In such case, the status may be improved by changing the settings of
  [Resolution] on the [Advanced] tab.

* When a printed pattern or diagram is different from what you see on the
  screen, changing the following settings may alleviate the problem.
  - Change the [Image Quality] setting on the [Color Options] tab.
  - Change the [Image Types] and the [Image Auto Correction] settings on the
    [Color Options] tab.
  - Set [High Speed Image Processing] on the [Advanced] tab to [Off].
  - Set [Draw the pattern with fine lines as per the resolution] on the
    [Advanced] tab to [On].
  - Change the [Resolution] setting in the [Image Options] group on the
    [Advanced] tab.
  - Change the [Halftone Print] setting in the [Image Options] group on the
    [Advanced] tab.

* Blank Separators
  If you set [EMF Spooling] to [Enabled] or specify Header, Footer and Watermark,
  and perform [2-Sided Print] with documents of odd number of pages, a blank page
  may be inserted on the last page depending on application or OS.

* The print layout may be changed when you change the [Image Quality] in the
  [Color Options] tab.

* Depending on the application, if the resolution of the driver is high, the
  size of the print data may become huge and printing cannot be done properly.
  When this happens, specify the following settings:
  - Specify the [Resolution] in the [Image Options] group in the [Advanced] tab
    to [300dpi] or [200dpi].

* For some applications, if a pasted image is printed at high resolution, the
  print data expands and may result in an extremely slow printing speed.
  The print data size of the output may be improved by changing the following
  settings of [Image Options] group on the [Advanced] tab.
  - Specify the [Image Compression] to [Standard] or [Photo] or [Resolution] to
    [300dpi] or [200dpi].

* When printing from the application of QuarkXPress 6.1E, if the [Image Quality]
  setting is [High Resolution] and the resolution of the driver is [1200dpi],
  the document may be printed as blank pages. This issue can be avoided by
  changing the resolution of the driver to [Auto].

* When doing a print job by specifying Paper Source as Auto, be sure to set
  Paper Size in the application to the Paper Size that the driver supports to
  enable the automatic paper feed feature.

* When using the Form Overlay feature, use form data of the same Paper Size,
  Resolution, and Image Settings as those of the document you want to print.
  If these settings are different between form data and the page where the form
  data is incorporated, expected print results may not be obtained.

* When using Form Overlay, as some applications paint the background in white
  to print, forms with overlay may be hidden. Such applications include
  Internet Explorer and WordPad.

* With Adobe PageMaker, when this printer is specified for [Compose to printer],
  a layout may change in printing. This issue can be avoided by performing the
  following steps;

  <1> Do not set [Compose to printer].
  <2> Change the [Margins] setting in advance in the printer folder.

* The print result may overlap if Pages Per Sheet (N-Up) and Margins [Standard]
  are selected when printing a document that has exceeded the print area of the
  print driver. When this happens, choose [None] of the [Margins] radio button
  group on the [Image Options] tab.

* When you cancel a fax job in progress from the driver, the application may
  display a warning dialog box. It may indicate a printer error message,
  although there is no error in the printer. In this case, ignore the warning
  message and continue operation.

* To use the [Store in Remote Folder] feature, you must obtain the be
  registered recipient's folder number and passcode in advance.
  Refer to the machine administrator guide on how to create a folder.

* Depending on the application used by the customer, blank pages for page
  adjustment will be inserted automatically according to the conditions like
  the number of copies specified when outputting 2-sided prints.
  In this case, the blank inserts will be included by the application.
  The performance may be improved by changing the setting below.
  - Check [Skip Blank Pages] on [Advanced] tab.

* Even with [Skip Blank Pages] selected, blank pages may still be printed in
  the following situations.
  - The page contains only line feeds.
  - The page contains only spaces.
  - The page contains only line feeds and spaces.
  - A white background drawing instruction is sent from the application.

* With Microsoft Word, even if [Skip Blank Pages] is specified, when a blank
  page is included in documents, it may be output.

* [Cancel] button on [User Details Setup] Dialog
  For some applications, if [Enter User Details] dialog is cancelled when
  printing with the settings of [Prompt User for Entry when Submitting job] on
  [User Details Setup] dialog, a warning dialog may be displayed.
  This warning dialog may indicate a printer error, however, the printer
  actually has no problem.

  In that case, ignore the warning and continue.

* When [EMF Spooling] of [Advanced] tab is set to [Disabled], some documents
  with complex structure may have troubles such as distorted output image and
  failure of the output.

* To change the settings of Custom Paper Size, you need the Administrator
  access rights. Select printer from the printer folder,
  right-click to go [Run as administrator] and select [Properties].
  After clicking [Continue] in [User Account Control], you can change
  the settings from Property.

  When Custom Paper Size equal to the standard paper size is specified in Paper
  Size, the print job may be performed as if a [standard] paper size was
  specified.
  To output as a Custom Paper Size, specify Custom Paper Size in Output Size.

* There are feature restrictions below on the execution of Fax print in
  Protected Mode of Microsoft Internet Explorer.
  - A warning message may be displayed right after the execution of Fax print.
  - The location for storage of Fax Phonebook is not a Public Folder, which is
    usually used for storage but a folder such as personal Folder, which can be
    used for file creation. Therefore, the contents of Fax Phonebook are
    different from the one registered with other applications.
  - Import To List feature of Fax Phonebook does not function.

* There is a restriction in creating file from Microsoft Internet Explorer.
  You cannot save form data file in the folder specified as the default in
  [Create / Register Forms]. Change the folder into one that can be used for
  creating file (such as "Document Folder") before creating/registering form
  data file.

* The following functions are restricted with use of Microsoft Internet Explorer
  in Protected Mode.
  - The setting items for [Job Type] ([Secure Print] / [Sample Set] /
    [Delayed Print] / [Store in Remote Folder]) can not be edited.
  - The functions of [Saved Settings], [Save] and [Edit] are disabled.
  - The functions of [Watermark], [New], [Edit] and [Delete] are disabled.
  - The setting of [Notify Job Completion by E-mail] can not be changed.
  To change the settings of these functions, open the default setting of
  the document from the Printer Folder.

* Notes and limitations about the server-client environment
- Server-Client Environment Issue (1)
  If the printer is being used as a shared printer and the server's operating
  system is being upgraded, a message indicating that the driver has to be
  updated may appear on the client, causing printing to fail.
  In this case, the print driver has to be reinstall on the client to be able
  to print again.

- Server-Client Environment Issue (2)
  In the Server-Client environment, after a print driver is added or upgraded
  on the Server side, printing may not be performed with a displayed message
  requiring print driver upgrade on the Client side.
  This problem can be avoided by the settings below.

  < Change of Group Policy Settings on Client PC >
  1. Log on as an Administrator on Client PC.
  2. Open command prompt and execute "gpedit.msc". to open [Local Group Policy
     Editor].

  and then confirm that [Output Color] on the [Paper/Output] tab of the
  [Printing Preferences] dialog is set to [Color].
  If the setting of [Output Color] on the [Paper/Output] tab of the [Printing
  Preferences] dialog remains [Black and White], the output will be in black and
  white even if you specify Color Mode to [Color] on the printing setting screen
  shown after you select printer from the device charm.

* Limitations on Adobe Acrobat/Reader
  When you specify [2] or more pages for [Copies] on the [Print] dialog of
  Adobe Acrobat/Reader, Fax may not be transmitted normally.
